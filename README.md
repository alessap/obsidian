# Obsidian [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanheule/obsidian.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanheule/obsidian)

![Obsidian banner](resources/images/banner.png)

**Disclaimer**: This is a fork of [obsidian](https://github.com/stefanheule/obsidian) where I added steps and heart BPM with inspiration from [ivanmihov's code](https://github.com/ivanmihov/pebble-analogfit). Thank you both for making your code publicly available. The watchface has been built and tested ONLY for Pebble 2+HR (diorite).

Available in the Pebble App Store:

## Overview

This is a usable and elegant analog watchface for the Original Pebble, Pebble Steel, Pebble Time, Pebble Time Steel, Pebble Time Round, Pebble 2 and the Pebble Time 2.
It's main features are:

- High contrast colors, clearly visible in most light conditions.
- Display of the current date (day and month) as well as day of the week.
- The date display is never obstructed by the watch hands.  If they would cover the date, the date moves slightly to the side.
- Display the current weather information (icon and temperature).  Just like the date, this information is never obstructed.
- Weather information in Celcius or Fahrentheit.  Weather information source is configurable to use [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/), [darksky.net](https://darksky.net/), or [wunderground.com](https://www.wunderground.com/).  Note that darksky.net and wunderground.com require a (free) API key.
- Weather is displayed for the current location by default, but it is possible to set a fixed location.
- Display of the battery level.
- Change in background for low battery levels (yellow at 30%, orange at 20%, and red at 10%).
- Vibrates when the bluetooth connection is lost or regained, shows an information overlay for a few seconds and keeps showing an icon when no connection is available.
- Fully configurable, both in terms of appearance (colors, minute/hour ticks, etc.) as well as behavior (if and when to vibrate, show messages, etc.).

## Screenshots (Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel)

The main goal when building this watchface was for it to be practical.  For instance, the date display should never be obstructed by the watch hands:

![Screenshot of the date display moving](screenshots/basalt/date.png)

The watchface also features weather information:

The watchface also alerts the user when the bluetooth connection is lost or regained, by vibrating and showing an information overlay.  After a few seconds, the overlay goes away, and a small bluetooth icon stays if no connection is available:

![Screenshot of the bluetooth alerts](screenshots/basalt/bluetooth.png)

The watchface always shows a small battery indicator in the top right corner.  However, if the battery starts running low, the background changes to yellow, orange and finally red:

Finally, it is fully configurable, both in terms of what it looks like as well as its behavior (vibration, bluetooth message, etc.).  Some screenshots of different configurations:

The configuration dialog to achieve this flexibility looks as follows:

## Screenshots (Pebble Time Round)

The watchface also supports the Pebble Time Round:

## FAQ

**No weather information is displayed**

There are many possible causes:

- Make sure weather is turned on in the settings.
- Ensure that your phone is connected to the internet.
- Make sure the color for the weather information is different from the background color.
- If you use darksky.net or wunderground.com as a weather source, make sure the API key is correct.
- If you use a custom location, make sure it is a valid location.

**What does it mean when the degree sign is missing for the weather?**

In this case, the last attempt to update the weather failed.  This can be for any number of reasons (see above).  Obsidian will keep displaying the previous weather information until it expires.

**I still use Pebble OS 3 and the latest Obsidian does not work.  What can I do?**

There is an [older version available on the Pebble App Store](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57e56bd087d6bb99f1000298).

## Building from Source

The project can be build using the command `make build`.  The `Makefile` also includes various other targets, such as ones to install the watchface in an emulator or on the Pebble watch.  There are also targets to automatically take the screenshots that are part of this distribution.

### Versioning

The watchface itself uses relatively arbitrary version numbers of MAJOR.MINOR.  In addition to that, the configuration format (the JavaScript config object) is versioned, too, using a single integer.  Different version of the watchface may share the same configuration format.

| Watchface version | Configuration version |
|------------------:|----------------------:|
|         up to 1.2 |                     1 |
|               1.3 |                     2 |
|               1.4 |                     3 |
|               1.5 |                     4 |

## Influence

There are a few watch faces that have influenced the design of Obsidian:

- [Minimalin](https://github.com/groyoh/minimalin).  Great watchface under the [MIT Licence](licences/mit.txt), from
which I borrow some code related to getting weather information.  I also use their NUPE font, which they provide
under the [Open Font Licence](licences/ofl.txt).  I modified the font to include more weather icons, as well as
making some of the existing icons more accurate, and I call the resulting font NUPE2.  For the aplite and basalt
platforms, I modified NUPE2 slightly further to include a smaller font for numbers, and call the font NUPE2_small.
Both modifications are again licenced under the [Open Font Licence](licences/ofl.txt).
- [Simple.Watch](http://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5551c537c60fc8732d000006)
- [TH3](http://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5551c4a91113bc93a00000de)

I would also like to thank Tamás Iván who implemented most of the second hand feature.
